% Problem: Implement a system that plans breakfast,
% lunch, and dinner for one day, based upon the user's
% preferences.  The system first asks the user about his
% or her preferences by at least 3 questions. Then it
% runs an expert system to derive the menu for breakfast,
% lunch, and dinner IN THAT ORDER. You can ask any questions
% that you wish. The system should plan different
% menus depending on the answers, though it is okay to have
% the same menu for some answers. Screen shots should show
% the output of your program for EVERY REASONABLE INPUT.

% Here are some sample interactions. (Note that the FC rule
% interpreter wrote "Derived ..." and "No more facts" and
% Prolog wrote 'true'.)
